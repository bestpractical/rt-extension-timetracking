CONFIGURATION
  $TimeTrackingFirstDayOfWeek
    The default week start day in MyWeek page is Monday, you can change it
    by setting $TimeTrackingFirstDayOfWeek, e.g.

        Set($TimeTrackingFirstDayOfWeek, 'Wednesday');

  $TimeTrackingDisplayCF
    In the ticket listings on the My Week page, there is a room for an
    additional field next to Status, Owner, etc. To display a custom field
    that might be helpful when filling out your timesheet, you can set
    $TimeTrackingDisplayCF to the name of that custom field. In the display,
    that field name will be added to the ticket heading between Owner and
    Time Worked for each day on My Week. The value will be populated for
    each ticket.

METHODS
  WeekStartDate
    Accepts an RT::User object, an RT::Date object and a day of the week
    (Monday, Tuesday, etc.) and calculates the start date for the week the
    date object is in using the passed day as the first day of the week. The
    default first day of the week is Monday.

    Returns:

    ($ret, $week_start, $first_day)

    where $ret is true on success, false on error, $week_start is an
    RT::Date object set to the calculated date, and $first_day is a string
    of the first day of the week, either from $TimeTrackingFirstDayOfWeek or
    the default of Monday.
